# Cat Clicker Application

I built this app as a practice assigningment of my Knockout JS learning class.

## What is in the Application

This app is just implementation of some basic concepts of Knockout JS.
This app is simply a list of cats with their individual names, nicknames and click counts.

## How does this work.

- Just load the `index.html` in any browser.
- Click on Individual cat to load that cat.
- Click on the cat to increase the click-count.
- Then according to the number of click-counts the cats will be given titles.

## How to Run

- Fork or Download the project and open the `index.html` in your browser.

## Dependancy

This app needs **[Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/)** to function.
